# Virtual Mouse - Hand Gesture Control System

## What is this project?
A computer vision application that allows users to control their computer mouse cursor and perform mouse actions using hand gestures captured through a webcam. The system uses real-time hand tracking to translate finger movements into mouse commands.

## Objective
To create a touchless computer interaction system that enables users to control their mouse without physical contact, making computing more accessible and providing an alternative input method through natural hand gestures.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.9** - Core programming language
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision library for camera input and image processing
- **MediaPipe** - Google's framework for real-time hand landmark detection
- **PyAutoGUI** - Cross-platform GUI automation for mouse control
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing for coordinate mapping and calculations
- **PyCaw** - Windows audio control library (optional)
- **Comtypes** - Windows COM interface support

## Use Cases
- **Accessibility**: Assist users with limited mobility or hand disabilities
- **Hygiene**: Touchless computer interaction in medical or clean environments
- **Presentations**: Control slides and cursor during presentations without physical devices
- **Gaming**: Alternative control method for certain types of games
- **Education**: Demonstrate gesture-based interaction concepts
- **Remote Control**: Control computer from a distance when physical access is limited
